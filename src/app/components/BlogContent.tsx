      <TextContent>
        Next.js 15 is designed with a strong focus on speed and efficiency,
        delivering an optimal experience even for high-traffic applications. The
        following features make it stand out:

      <TextContent>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
          <li className="mt-3">
            <b>Optimized Build Size: </b>
            Next.js 15 reduces the build size, ensuring that only essential code
            is loaded at runtime, which significantly lowers initial load times
            and improves performance, particularly on slower networks.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>How it Works: </b>
            By minimizing the overall bundle size through techniques like
            tree-shaking and removing unused code, Next.js allows faster page
            rendering.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Example Use Case: </b>
            Imagine an online magazine with heavy multimedia content. Optimized
            build size ensures articles and images load quickly, improving user
            satisfaction and retention.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3">
            <b>Improved Code Splitting : </b>
            This feature allows applications to load only what is needed, based
            on user interactions, which makes loading times faster and enhances
            responsiveness.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Explanation: </b>
            Code-splitting breaks the application into smaller chunks, loading
            only the required components when needed (e.g., lazy loading
            components when they are scrolled into view).
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Code Example: </b>
            Here, <b>HeavyComponent</b> will load only when required, reducing
            initial page load time.

          <li className="mt-3">
            <b>Efficient Asset Caching: </b>
            With smarter caching strategies, Next.js 15 minimizes redundant
            loads by caching static assets, CSS, and JavaScript, boosting page
            load speeds for repeat visitors.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Explanation: </b>
            Caching allows the browser to store and reuse assets locally rather
            than fetching them from the server every time. This reduces network
            requests and improves speed.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Example Use Case: </b>
            For an e-commerce website, caching enables faster browsing through
            product pages, as assets are loaded from cache rather than being
            fetched repeatedly.

      <HeadingH5 headingFive="Enhanced Server Actions: Power Up Your Backend" />
      <TextContent>
        Next.js 15 introduces powerful server actions that streamline
        server-side operations, making it easier for developers to handle
        complex tasks on the backend. This upgrade brings numerous benefits:

        <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
          <li className="mt-3">
            <b>Simplified Data Fetching: </b>
            Server actions in Next.js 15 make data retrieval more efficient by
            centralizing API requests on the server, reducing the need for
            multiple client-side requests.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Explanation: </b>
            This ensures that the page has all necessary data before its
            rendered, which reduces loading time and enhances SEO by serving
            fully populated pages.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Code Example: </b>
            This example demonstrates how data is fetched server-side, so the
            component receives fully loaded data without additional API calls.

          <li className="mt-3">
            <b>Built for Scalability: </b>
            Next.js 15s server actions are designed to handle large amounts of
            data, making it suitable for data-heavy applications that serve
            high-traffic environments, like news websites or financial
            dashboards.

          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Explanation: </b>
            As data volumes grow, Next.js ensures efficient server performance
            and minimal latency.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Example Use Case: </b>A social media application with millions of
            posts and user data requires scalable data fetching to manage heavy
            user traffic seamlessly.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3">
            <b>Reduced API Calls: </b>
            Fewer API calls between the client and server improve performance,
            reduce latency, and can lower server costs.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Explanation: </b>
            By batching multiple API calls into a single server action, Next.js
            minimizes the number of requests sent over the network.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Example Use Case: </b>
            An analytics dashboard with multiple data sources can combine these
            into fewer API calls, providing faster load times and reduced
            bandwidth usage.

          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Explanation: </b>
            Nested routing enables a clear parent-child relationship in URLs,

          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Explanation: </b>
            Error boundaries ensure users do not encounter blank screens during
            navigation errors. Instead, they are redirected to an error page or
            message.

          <li className="mt-3 ml-10">
            <b>Example Use Case: </b>
            If a user navigates to a page that does not exist, Next.js 15
            displays an error message rather than a blank page, keeping users
            engaged.
